To test an API endpoint, first, I need to understand what it does. Then I think of different scenarios to test,
using valid and invalid inputs, and checking how it handles errors. Next, I set up a testing environment
and start writing the tests based on E2E, BE, Sanity tests.
Finally, I run the tests and check if the endpoint behaves as expected.
This process is being documented and repeated whenever there are updates to the API endpoint.

a. Parameters Type: I would test different types of parameters including valid and invalid types,
so I can make sure the system works as expected.

b. Logical Constraints: To my knowledge, I would test the camera properties as they can't be changed when the camera is capturing.

- I would need the SDK documentation so I can know about the available functions and their behavior.
- I would like to know what happens on specific error situations, like how would the camera work when facing an unexpected error so it's possible to test it better
